## Test Summary

| Test | Status | Impact | Details |
|------|--------|--------|---------|

## Test 1: Memory Reality Check

### What We Measured
- 5M rows in pandas DataFrame = **1.4 GB**
- Extrapolated: 225M rows = **63 GB** (impossible!)

### Critical Finding ⚠️
```
❌ Cannot load full dataset into pandas (63GB > 16GB RAM)
✅ Must use compressed columnar format
✅ Our 7GB budget was correct for COMPRESSED data
```

### Revised Memory Budget
```
Approach                    Memory Usage
────────────────────────────────────────
❌ Pandas full dataset:    63 GB (impossible)
✅ Columnar compressed:    ~6 GB (achievable)
   - LZ4 compression       ~5-6 GB
   - Dictionaries          ~100 MB
   - Pre-aggs              ~50 MB
   - Query buffers         ~500 MB
   - Python overhead       ~500 MB
   ──────────────────────────────────
   TOTAL:                  ~7 GB ✅
```

### Verdict
Our memory strategy is **valid** but we MUST:
- ✅ Use columnar compression (not pandas DataFrames)
- ✅ Load only needed partitions
- ✅ Stream processing during build phase

---

## Test 2: Numeric Correctness ❌ CRITICAL BUG

### Tests Run
1. ✅ AVG with NULLs - PASS
2. ❌ SUM with NULLs - **FAIL**
3. ✅ COUNT(*) vs COUNT(column) - PASS
4. ✅ Empty groups - PASS
5. ✅ Float precision - PASS

### CRITICAL BUG FOUND ⚠️⚠️⚠️

```python
# Test case: SUM of all-NULL column
test_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'type': ['click', 'click'],
    'bid_price': [None, None]
})

# DuckDB result:
# type='click', SUM(bid_price) = NULL

# Pandas result:
# type='click', SUM(bid_price) = 0.0

# ❌ MISMATCH!
```

### Impact
- **-5% per wrong query**
- This affects queries with sparse columns (bid_price, total_price)
- Must explicitly handle: `if all values are NULL, return NULL (not 0)`

### Fix Required
```python
def safe_sum(values):
    non_null = values.dropna()
    if len(non_null) == 0:
        return None  # NOT 0!
    return non_null.sum()
```

### Verdict
**MUST FIX before proceeding!** This will cause wrong results.

## Test 3: Build Time Estimation

### Measurements
- Read 1 CSV file (5M rows): **7.4 seconds**
- Read speed: **675K rows/sec**
- Total read time (49 files): **6.1 minutes**
- With processing overhead (2×): **12.1 minutes**

### Concern ⚠️
```
Prepare phase: ~12 minutes
Target: < 10 minutes (judges might penalize)
```

### Mitigation Options
1. **Parallel processing** (use 4 cores)
   - Estimated time: 12 min / 4 = **3 minutes** ✅
2. **Optimize CSV parsing** (use polars instead of pandas)
   - Polars is 5-10× faster
   - Estimated time: **1-2 minutes** ✅
3. **Skip unnecessary columns** during build
   - Only read needed columns
   - Saves ~30% time

### Verdict
- ✅ **Use parallel processing** - easy win
- ✅ **Consider polars** for CSV reading
- Target: <5 minutes prepare phase

---

## Test 4: Cold Start Latency ✅

### Measurements
- Import pandas/numpy: **0.2s**
- Load dictionaries: **< 0.001s**
- Load pre-agg indexes: **< 0.001s**
- File open + read 1MB: **< 0.001s**
- **Total: ~0.2s** ✅

### Verdict
✅ Cold start is **fast enough**
- No optimization needed
- mmap will keep things warm after first query

## Revised Performance Expectations

### Original (Optimistic) Estimates
```
Q1: 13.5s → 10-50ms    (270-1350× speedup)
Q2: 12.4s → 5-20ms     (620-2480× speedup)
Q3: 11.4s → 1-5ms      (2280-11400× speedup)
Q4: 12.5s → 10-50ms    (250-1250× speedup)
Q5: 15.4s → 20-100ms   (154-770× speedup)

Total: 65s → 50-250ms (260-1300× speedup)
```

### Revised (Realistic) Estimates
Based on actual measurements:

```
Q1 (scan 73M rows):
- Decompress ~2GB: ~700ms (3GB/s)
- Aggregate: ~100ms
- Total: ~800ms (17× speedup) ⚠️

Q2 (scan 24K rows after filters):
- Pre-agg hit: <10ms
- Total: ~10-20ms (620-1240× speedup) ✅

Q3 (scan 18K rows):
- Pre-agg hit: <5ms
- Total: ~5-10ms (1140-2280× speedup) ✅

Q4 (full scan 225M rows):
- Pre-agg (advertiser, type): <50ms
- Total: ~50-100ms (125-250× speedup) ✅

Q5 (scan 73M rows):
- Decompress: ~700ms
- Aggregate by minute: ~200ms
- Total: ~900ms (17× speedup) ⚠️

REVISED TOTAL: 50s → 2-3s (21-32× speedup)
```

### Why the Revision?
1. **Decompression is NOT free**: 700ms for 2GB @ 3GB/s
2. **Aggregation overhead**: ~100-200ms per query
3. **Q1 and Q5 don't hit pre-aggs well** (minute-level granularity)

### New Targets
- **Conservative**: <5s total (13× speedup) ✅ ACHIEVABLE
- **Target**: <3s total (21× speedup) ✅ LIKELY
- **Stretch**: <2s total (32× speedup) 🤔 POSSIBLE

## Critical Action Items

### MUST DO (Blockers)
1. ❌ **Fix NULL handling in SUM/AVG**
   - Pandas returns 0, DuckDB returns NULL
   - Must explicitly check for all-NULL groups
   - **Priority: CRITICAL**

2. ⚠️ **Optimize build time to <5 minutes**
   - Use parallel processing (4 cores)
   - Consider polars for CSV reading
   - **Priority: HIGH**

3. ✅ **Use columnar compression**
   - Cannot use pandas DataFrames (63GB)
   - Must use LZ4 compressed columns
   - **Priority: HIGH**

### SHOULD DO (Important)
4. **Build pre-agg for (minute, type)**
   - Q5 currently slow (~900ms)
   - Pre-agg would reduce to <50ms
   - **Priority: MEDIUM**

5. **Add minute-level pre-agg for Q1**
   - Daily aggregation still scans 73M rows
   - Pre-compute daily rollups
   - **Priority: MEDIUM**

### NICE TO HAVE
6. Test with actual query routing logic
7. Profile memory under load (multiple queries)
8. Cold start optimization (already fast)

---

## Updated Optimization Strategy

### What's VALIDATED ✅
- Type partitioning (80% query frequency)
- Pre-aggs are tiny (1.5K-6K rows)
- LZ4 is fast (3GB/s decompress)
- Cold start is fast (<1s)
- Memory budget is achievable (7GB)

### What's ADJUSTED ⚠️
- Cannot use pandas for full dataset (use columnar)
- Build time needs optimization (parallel + polars)
- Performance expectations lowered (2-3s vs 0.5s)
- NULL handling needs explicit fix

### What's BROKEN ❌
- SUM with all-NULL returns 0 instead of NULL
- Must fix before any implementation

---

## Final Confidence Assessment

### Overall: 🟢🟢🟢⚪⚪ (3/5 - Medium-High Confidence)

**What we're confident about**:
- ✅ Pre-aggregation strategy works
- ✅ Type partitioning is valuable
- ✅ Memory budget is achievable
- ✅ Cold start is fast enough

**What we're concerned about**:
- ❌ NULL handling bug (must fix)
- ⚠️ Build time might be slow (needs optimization)
- ⚠️ Q1/Q5 slower than expected (need better pre-aggs)
- ⚠️ Holdout queries might have different patterns

**Adjusted expectations**:
- Target: **<3s total** (was <1s)
- Minimum: **<5s total** (was <2s)
- Stretch: **<2s total** (was <500ms)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (DO NOT SKIP)
1. Implement NULL-safe SUM/AVG
2. Build test harness for correctness validation
3. Test NULL handling on real data

### Short-term (This Weekend)
1. Build columnar converter with LZ4
2. Implement parallel pre-agg builder
3. Build query router with pre-agg matching

### Before Judging
1. End-to-end correctness tests
2. Memory profiling under load
3. Performance tuning

**Conclusion**: Our strategy is **fundamentally sound** but we found **critical bugs** and needed to **adjust expectations**. We can still win, but margin for error is smaller than we thought.
